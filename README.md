## **Common User Credentials for Signup**

Here’s a list of essential credentials needed for a user to sign up:
>
1. **Full Name**
    - **Purpose**: For personal identification and to personalize the user experience.
   
2. **Email Address**
    - **Purpose**: Used for account verification, password recovery, and communication.
    - **Validation**: Ensure correct format and use email verification (e.g., sending a verification link).
   
3. **Username** *(optional)*
    - **Purpose**: Alternative to using addresses if the platform supports user-to-user transfers via usernames.

4. **Password**
    - **Purpose**: For secure access to the user’s account.
    - **Security**: Enforce strong password policies and securely store using hashing algorithms like `bcrypt`.
   
5. **Phone Number** *(optional but recommended)*
    - **Purpose**: For two-factor authentication (2FA), account recovery, and additional verification.
    - **Validation**: Use SMS verification to confirm the phone number.

6. **Ethereum Wallet Address** *(if applicable)*
    - **Purpose**: Connect users' Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask) for transactions.
    - **Security**: Only request the public wallet address, never private keys.
   
7. **KYC Details** *(optional for compliance)*
    - **Purpose**: For identity verification, if required by financial regulations.
    - **Security**: Securely store and manage compliance with data protection laws.

8. **Country and Date of Birth** *(optional)*
    - **Purpose**: For regulatory purposes like age restrictions or compliance.
    - **Validation**: Ensure compliance with age-related restrictions.

9. **Profile Picture** *(optional)*
    - **Purpose**: Enhance user profile, but not essential for signup.

## **Security Measures During Signup**

- **Email Verification**: Send verification emails with confirmation links to ensure authenticity.
- **Jwt Algorithm**: Enhancing security: Secure user authentication and authorization. Verify identity and grant access based on roles and permissions.
- **CAPTCHA**: Prevent bot signups using CAPTCHA.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Strongly encourage users to enable 2FA (via SMS, email, or an authentication app).
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement limits to prevent brute-force attacks during signup attempts.
